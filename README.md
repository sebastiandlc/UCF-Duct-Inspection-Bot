# UCF Duct Inspection Bot

### About

This project was a collaborative effort between a group of mechanical engineering and computer science students at UCF. The goal was to design and create a robot capable of traversing and mapping air ducts for the UCF Utilities and Energy Services Department.

This project will NOT compile as it requires the robot, along with additional code files stored on it. For more information, please refer to the conference paper or the final presentation files.

Relevant source code files can be found under ```/src``` and the control application files can be found under either ```./src/control_app (stable)``` or ```./src/control app (latest)```.
